# boolequiv_benchmarks
Contains benchmarks for affine equivalence.

# files
- ex_affeq_results.csv: timing results from benchmark
- encodings.zip: collection of different encodings
- affineonly_instances_2k.zip: collection of problem instances that comprise the affine equivalence benchmark
- instances_2k.zip: collection of problem instances (Boolean function pairs) that comprise the extended affine equivalence benchmark
- make_dimacs_from_instance.py: Python script to convert a problem instance into a fragment of a .dimacs file; output should be concatenated to an encoding in order to obtain the SAT problem
